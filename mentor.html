		<center><h2>The Mentor Program</h2></center>

		<p>Those who have are need help learning new strategies or are struggling in wars will have a mentor to help them get better. This mainly applies to new members who are not yet familiar with our attack strategies. Anyone that wants one will recieve a mentor, and are expected to let the mentors help them with their war attacks.</p>

		<p>The mentors are selected by leadership (elders and above), to qualify for the role of mentor, one must be willing to help out "mentees", have at least a 2.5 average at Town Hall 8, at least a 2.5 average at Town Hall 9, and at least a 2.1 average at TH 10. The mentors are expected to be helpful to their mentees and are expected to plan the mentee's attack with him/her.</p>

		<p>The program ends for the mentee when he has "graduated," or reached an acceptable war average, which is a 2.4 or above average at Town Hall 8, a 2.3 or above average at Town Hall 9, and a 2.0 or above average at Town Hall 10.</p>
